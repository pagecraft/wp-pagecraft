wp-pagecraft
============

Pagecraft plugin for WordPress

## Goals

The essential goal is to build a framework for quickly building and scaffolding actor websites in WordPress.

Tasks that this plugin will accomplish:

+ Register appropriate custom post types
+ Create necessary pages (Bio, Gallery, etc.)
+ Provide basic content editing tools
+ Walk actors through the process of setting up their site
+ Simplify the WordPress administrative interface

Pagecraft for WordPress will be a "layer" over WordPress in the same way that, say, BuddyPress is. The intention is that this plugin would be set up immediately after the installation of a WordPress site.

Pagecraft for WordPress will be able to interact with "add-on" plugins that provide additional types of pages, etc.
